# ALPACA

ALPACA is a Java-based platformer video game I made with three other people (Josh Garafalo, Ryan Tiedemann, and Esha Singhai), utilizing the Java Slick2D Graphics Library. My role for this project was primarily as a back-end developer focused on creating the game physics and collision mechanics, a scalable level-design engine, and a tiling texture rendering system; all of these were then used by the other members of this project to create the final product.
